						My journey learning to program started in college, when I was 18 years old. First semester into my
						Electrical Engineering undergraduate program, among calculus, physics, chemistry and some other
						introductory classes, there it was: an introductory class to algorithms and programming with Portugol and
						<strong>C</strong>. It was my first contact with this world.

						I'm often asked though, what does my Major have to do with programming and Computer Science? Well, of
						course there's a slight focus on the electrical parts of everything instead of just the software. But, not
						only we learn to code in the first couple of semesters, we also learn about how computers work, how they
						comunicate, hardware, among other things. I even had some projects with Arduino and tinkering with
						robotics as well.

						One example of something I studied in my Major is how leds work: we were taught some of the theory and
						studied the parts it's made of, we got to know the voltage necessary to turn it on and to burn it out.
						And, in addition, we programmed an arduino to get the necessary voltage to turn it on when it should be
						turned on. As a project, our class tried to use that knowledge make an automated house mockup.

						Though I learned a bit of Portugol, C and programming in MATLAB and Scilab in the first half of my college
						career, what really hooked me in was Python. My first project with it was around my 6th semester of
						college: a "calculator" with Tkinter. I programmed for 10 hours straight, through the night. I couldn't
						sleep even if I wanted, it was so much fun and interesting I couldn't believe it.

						By the beginning of my 9th semester I started learning about A.I., Machine Learning, Artificial Neural
						Networks and the like. I've always loved maths, and my mind was blown away by how calculus and matrices
						were being used here. I couldn't help but to choose this subject as my final project for my major. In
						short, I personally collected and manually (through scripts I wrote myself) organized the data for this
						project (four thousand radiographies and their annotations), trained a few Convolutional models with
						Tensorflow and reported my findings making a parallel with the state of the art. It was wondrous!

						Through all that, I also did a lot of online courses. One obviously won't learn everything in college. So
						I did a few certified specializations in Coursera when they started "Coursera for Students". And that's
						about when I started to learn and understand Object Oriented Programming. Later, this knowledge was
						essential to solving a few programming problems in my C.S. Master's degree.

						Nowadays, after learning and doing some projects with C#, Windows Forms, SQL, some larger Python projects
						among other things, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is ingrained in my mind. I'm usually involved in
						quite a few projects: some are personal and I'm working by myself, while some others are other people's
						ideas and I'm working with them. So I'm getting experience working in teams too. Check out
						<a href="https://github.com/ArielMAJ">my GitHub page</a>, if you're interested in seeing some of the

						I also am learning HTML5/CSS3 and JS. And this website is your proof: I wrote it from scratch! Pretty nice
						looking, don't you think? I did my best to make it as responsive as possible. It should look nice in
						computers in whatever size you put the window and also in most smartphones and tablets too. Try it out!

						Of course, among everything I've been learning, I also learned a bit about software versioning with
						GitHub! If you're here, you've probably already seen some links to my GitHub page around. I have a goal of
						getting a whole year worth of green squares in my contribution activity, as doing at least one
						contribution a day forces me to code everyday. It has been fun so far!

					Finally, considering my love for maths, programming and my unwavering interest in AI, I felt compelled to
					pursue a Master's Degreee in Computer Science, researching AI, as soon as I got my undergraduate degree. My
					learning career is unstoppable now with this graduate program in addition to the many online courses and
					projects I'm working on!
